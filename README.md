# Cobb Douglas Function
In economics and econometrics, the Cobb Douglas production function is a particular
functional form of the production function, widely used to represent the
technological relationship between the amounts of two or more inputs (particularly
physical capital and labor) and the amount of output that can be produced
by those inputs.
Output elasticity measures the responsiveness of output to a change in levels
of either labor or capital used in production, ceteris paribus. For example, if
\alpha = 0.45, a 1% increase in capital usage would lead to approximately a 0.45%
increase in output.
Sometimes the term has a more restricted meaning, requiring that the function
display constant returns to scale, meaning that doubling the usage of capital
K and labor L will also double output Y. This holds if
\alpha + \beta = 1;
If
\alpha + \beta < 1;
returns to scale are decreasing, and if
\alpha + \beta > 1;
returns to scale are increasing. Assuming perfect competition and \alpha + \beta = 1, \alpha
and \beta can be shown to be capital's and labor's shares of output.
